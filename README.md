# Collaborative Filtering in Python

This project utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to predict ratings that a user would give to a movie based on the ratings of other users. The goal is to provide a way to recommend movies that a user might enjoy based on the ratings they have given to other movies.

## How It Works
The collaborative filtering algorithm uses a matrix of user and movie ratings to calculate similarities between users. This information is then used to predict the rating that a user would give to a movie based on the ratings given by other users who are similar to them.

## How to Use
To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the Python file "Filtro Colaborativo.py". This file contains the implementation of the collaborative filtering algorithm and an example of how to use it to predict movie ratings for a specific user.
